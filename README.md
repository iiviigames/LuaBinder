# LuaBinder

Creates a Lua Environment using [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org).

To initialize the repo, you use the following link formatting to do so:

```bash
https://mybinder.org/{username}/{reponame}
```

Essentially, you can copy the link to your Github repo, and replace domains - swapping out _github.com_ for _mybinder.org_.

For this repo, it looks like this:

```bash
https://mybinder.org/iiviigames/LuaBinder
```
